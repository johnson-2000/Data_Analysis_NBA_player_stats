## NBA Player Stats Analysis (2021-2022 Season)

## Overview

The NBA Player Stats Analysis project explores the performance metrics of NBA players during the 2021-2022 season. Using Python, particularly the Pandas library, this project conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into player statistics and trends.

The project focuses on:

- **Data Import and Cleaning:** Utilizing Python's Pandas library to import NBA player statistics dataset and clean the data by handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting comprehensive EDA to analyze various aspects of player performance including points scored, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, field goal percentage, free throw percentage, and more.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features such as Efficiency (EFF) by combining existing metrics to provide a holistic view of player performance.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Investigating correlations between different player attributes to understand relationships and identify key performance indicators.

## Project Structure

- **NBA_Player_Stats_Analysis.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis, EDA, feature engineering, and correlation analysis.
- **README.md:** Documentation providing an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and insights derived from the analysis.
- **Data:** Folder containing the dataset used for analysis (2021-2022 NBA Player Stats - Regular.csv).
- **Report:** Formal business report summarizing the findings and insights from the analysis.

## Required Libraries

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- NetworkX
- DateTime

## Key Findings

- Significant correlations observed between certain player attributes, indicating their influence on overall performance.
- Trends in player performance identified based on position, age, and team affiliation.
- Insights into the effectiveness of different players across various statistical categories.

## Future Work

- Implement machine learning models to predict player performance based on historical data.
- Extend analysis to include advanced metrics such as Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and Win Shares (WS).
- Explore player performance in different game scenarios (e.g., clutch moments, home vs. away games).
